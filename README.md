- Hi, I’m Christine, @Odradexx.
- I’m interested in web design & open source code. Mainly I just want to be able to find ways to use the internet without big corporations getting in the way.
- I’m currently mostly working with HTML and CSS but eventually I'd like to expand my knowledge
- you can find me on my site Sacred Heart Witch (https://sacredheartwitch.neocities.org/index.html) and contact me there!
